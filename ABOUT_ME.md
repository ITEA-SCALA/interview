I am   Java developer,   and now   I work in IT.
Now   I am an employee   of an American trading company.
I develop web services   that use on bank structure   or   on some trading place.
I have   a total experience as a Java developer   for more   than eight years.

And also   I write some programs on another   software languages.
For example   PHP, JavaScript, Angular, Scala, GoLang.
I try   to write   strong and clean code,   and often   I do code review.

I can service   some server hardware.
Some time ago   I was   a build manager.
And   was preparing   some assemblies   to   next test phase.

But   I accepted hard solution   that   I would stay   the developer   for server applications.
In my last projects   I apply next   software technologies:
Spring and Spring Boot, 
JMS Active MQ and Kafka, 
JDK version from 7 to 17,
mono and microservices architecture, 
JPA with Hibernate ORM, 
MySql, PostgreSql, Oracle, Mongo relation   and   not relation databases.

In my tasks   I saluted   different   some problems   that   were associated with multi threading.
For example   usage KStream in Kafka   for join   some topics.
Or   usability   ExecutorService and CompletableFuture   for solution   some thread problems.

I like   integrate   and use   new software technologies.
And   I am good   at it.

Sometimes   occur   some software failure.
But   I am try   desperately research   and   understand   a reason they errors.

It helps me   understand   my errors.
And   I am learning   on self errors.

But   I not stay   on one place.
I always   wish   for learn of new.

And   me like   the Scala   software language.
The Scala language -   are hybrid language,   it usage   paradigm OOP programing   and   functional programming.
